# Power BI Sales Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project aims to design a dynamic and interactive Power BI dashboard that tracks essential sales metrics across four key regions: **Central, East, South, and West**. The dashboard provides users with the ability to filter data by year, switch between different metrics, and compare current and previous year sales figures.

## Dashboard Objectives
- **Track Key Metrics**: Visualize data for three primary metrics—**Sales**, **Profit**, and **Quantity**—with an option to dynamically switch between them.
- **Regional Analysis**: Provide insights across four regions: **Central**, **East**, **South**, and **West**.
- **Yearly Filtering**: Allow users to filter data by year to focus on specific time periods.
- **Year-over-Year Comparison**: Display a comparison of current year (CY) sales to previous year (PY) sales for a selected year, offering insights into sales growth or decline.

## Features
- **Dynamic Metric Selection**: Easily switch between Sales, Profit, and Quantity metrics to analyze different aspects of the data.
- **Interactive Region-Based Insights**: Break down performance by region, helping to identify high-performing and low-performing areas.
- **Year Filter**: Use the filter to narrow down data by year and analyze trends over time.
- **Current vs. Previous Year Sales**: Quickly compare current year sales with the previous year to assess yearly performance.
